Earlier revisions also added new policy objectives, refined employee categorization, included Pune in Class B cities, introduced dress code guidelines, formalized the travel approval process via Department Heads, and specified criteria for ticket changes, cancellations, accommodation, daily allowances, conveyance, and entertainment expenses.

The compensation amount is determined by considering the victim's mental trauma, career opportunity loss, medical expenses, and the respondent's income and financial status, with payment feasible in lump sum or installments. Crucially, the policy addresses misuse: if a complaint is found to be frivolous, false, or motivated by malafide intent, disciplinary actions may be initiated against the complainant.
